<p><span>&ldquo;Epistemological&rdquo;</span>
<span>Rose Zinnia </span></p>

<p><span>I could have chosen to write this poem about the</span><br><span>drastically entitled and out-of-his-mind-seeming</span><br><span>white septuagenarian who, clearly upset, yowled</span><br><span><em>I’M ABOUT TO BE UPSET</em>, while turning to address</span><br><span>a line-out-the-door post office like we were attending</span><br><span>his performance art piece, who said he was going to</span><br><span><em>BLOW UP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</em> because <em>YOU</em></span><br><span>wouldn’t give him a money order without proper ID, & I know,</span><br><span>technically, now I have written this poem about him, but would</span><br><span>you please set that aside for the moment & let me write to you</span><br><span>about how you remind me of a babysitter from my childhood—</span><br><span>Alex or Ian, Allison or Marie—telling me a secret I’m not supposed</span><br><span>to know just yet, because of age or subjective cultural context,</span><br><span>in your 2-door Honda bumping let’s talk about sex baby</span><br><span>as I gulp cans of Mr. Pibb in the backseat. You whisper</span><br><span>capital-T truth to me not to gain social capital, nor thwart</span><br><span>thine enemy, nor even to gain my confidence so that one day,</span><br><span>in the thick of an apocalyptic-type emergency, as we surely</span><br><span>shall be, I will decide to take <em>you</em> on my proverbial lifeboat</span><br><span>above all the others, no, nor not for any other self-serving</span><br><span>reason do you ladle generous amounts of altruistic, tender,</span><br><span>personal attention upon me, but just for that the fact that</span><br><span>we are alive together in this moment in time and space</span><br><span>and this post office was once a buffet-style restaurant</span><br><span>where, as a kid, I looked forward to eating the few times</span><br><span>of year we did, because this particular establishment</span><br><span>had the option to devour unlimited amounts of pizza</span><br><span>& soft serve ice cream, which now, you divulge to me,</span><br><span>the guys in the back call it <em>The Posterosa</em>, which</span><br><span>delights me, which salves me, which allows me to see</span><br><span>we a little more truly, this revealing of our secrets,</span><br><span>this dogged bursting through of taboo, which</span><br><span>palimpsests our souls a little closer with you</span><br><span>on me on I on us on them on they on we.</span></p>
